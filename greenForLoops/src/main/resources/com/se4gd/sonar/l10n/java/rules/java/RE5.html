<p>In the nested loop, even though a simple operation is running, the number of executions of the operation multiplies thereby affecting in energy saving as well as runtime performance. Therefore, refactoring of nested loops into a single loop is suggested</p>

    public void test() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                // Do some operations
            }

            int i = k / m;
